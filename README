Description:
A collection of scripts which somehow assist with the administration/
house-keeping and possibly development of Moodle.

last-modified-course.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This script can be used to show when Moodle courses were last
accessed, and by whom. It displays the information as a table with
extra, useful information. It will need some initial configuration (see
sections 1 and 2), after which it should work.

Note that where more information may exist about a course/user, it
has been added to the page as a 'title' attribute, which means that
it should appear after a small delay when you hover your pointer
over text on the screen.

There is a history of changes at the bottom of the script.
