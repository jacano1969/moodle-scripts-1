Description:
A collection of scripts which somehow assist with the administration/
house-keeping and possibly development of Moodle.

last-modified-course.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Moodle 1.9.x, 2.0.x.

This script can be used to show when Moodle courses were last
accessed, and by whom. It displays the information as a table with
extra, useful information. It will need some initial configuration (see
sections 1 and 2), after which it should work.

Note that where more information may exist about a course/user, it
has been added to the page as a 'title' attribute, which means that
it should appear after a small delay when you hover your pointer
over text on the screen.

There is a history of changes at the bottom of the script.

innodb-ify.php
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For MySQL 5.1.x. Will work on other versions of MySQL.

This script can be used to change the collation (character set: e.g.
latin, UTF8) of the database and tables, as well as the database storage
engine (e.g. MyISAM, InnoDB) for all tables in a named database.  It is
primarily intended to be used on the Moodle database, but can be used on
any named database and modified

This script changes how data is stored (although not the data itself) so
should be considered destructive: precautions should be taken before
using this script as sata loss is possible (but not likely).

Originally this script was the work of another person (unknown) and has
been adapted specifically to modify a Moodle database. It is crude but
does the job much more quickly than you could using another tool such as
PHPMyAdmin.

If you don't know why you should use this script, DO NOT USE IT.
